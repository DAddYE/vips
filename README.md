### Vips for go

This package is powered by the blazingly fast [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) image
processing library, originally created in 1989 at Birkbeck College and currently maintained by 
[JohnCupitt](https://github.com/jcupitt).

This is a loosely port of [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) an awesome module for node.js
built by [Lovell Fuller](https://github.com/lovell)

The typical use case for this high speed package is to convert large images of many formats
to smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG images of varying dimensions.

The performance of JPEG resizing is typically 8x faster than ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick, based
mainly on the number of CPU cores available.

When generating JPEG output all metadata is removed and Huffman tables optimised without having to
use separate command line tools like [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) and
[jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/).

## Installation

    go get github.com/daddye/vips

* [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) v7.38.5+

_libvips_ can take advantage of [liborc](http://code.entropywave.com/orc/) if present.

### Install libvips on Mac OS

    brew install vips --with-webp --without-fftw --without-libexif --without-libgsf \
      --without-little-cms2 --without-orc --without-pango --without-pygobject3 \
      --without-gobject-introspection --without-python

### Install libvips on Linux

Compiling from source is recommended:

    sudo apt-get install automake build-essential git gobject-introspection \
      libglib2.0-dev webp libjpeg-turbo8-dev libpng12-dev gtk-doc-tools
    git clone https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips.git
    cd libvips
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure --enable-debug=no --with-webp --without-python --without-fftw \
      --without-libexif --without-libgf --without-little-cms --without-orc \
      --without-pango --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

## Usage

You can use package from the command line (`go install github.com/daddye/vips/vips-cmd`):

    vips-cmd -file test.jpg -width 400 -height 600 > /tmp/test.jpg

Or simply importing the package and then:

```go
options := vips.Options{
	Width:        800,
	Height:       600,
	Crop:         false,
	Extend:       vips.EXTEND_WHITE,
	Interpolator: vips.BILINEAR,
	Gravity:      vips.CENTRE,
	Quality:      95,
}
f, _ := os.Open("/tmp/test.jpg")
inBuf, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(f)
buf, err := vips.Resize(inBuf, options)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
	return
}
// do some with your resized image `buf`
```

## Performance

Test by @lovell

### Test environment

* Intel Xeon [L5520](http://ark.intel.com/products/40201/Intel-Xeon-Processor-L5520-8M-Cache-2_26-GHz-5_86-GTs-Intel-QPI) 2.27GHz 8MB cache
* Ubuntu 13.10
* libvips 7.38.5

### The contenders

* [imagemagick-native](https://github.com/mash/node-imagemagick-native) - Supports Buffers only and blocks main V8 thread whilst processing.
* [imagemagick](https://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick) - Supports filesystem only and "has been unmaintained for a long time".
* [gm](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm) - Fully featured wrapper around GraphicsMagick.
* [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) - Caching within libvips disabled to ensure a fair comparison.

### The task

Decompress a 2725x2225 JPEG image, resize and crop to 720x480, then compress to JPEG.

### Results

| Module                | Input  | Output | Ops/sec | Speed-up |
| :-------------------- | :----- | :----- | ------: | -------: |
| imagemagick-native    | buffer | buffer |    0.97 |        1 |

| sharp                 | buffer | buffer |   12.43 |     12.8 |
| sharp                 | file   | file   |   13.02 |     13.4 |
| sharp                 | file   | buffer |   11.15 |     11.5 |
| sharp +sharpen        | file   | buffer |   10.26 |     10.6 |
| sharp +progressive    | file   | buffer |    9.44 |      9.7 |
| sharp +sequentialRead | file   | buffer |   11.94 |     12.3 |

You can expect much greater performance with caching enabled (default) and using 16+ core machines.
